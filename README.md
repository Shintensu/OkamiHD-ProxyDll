# OkamiHD-ProxyDll
Dinput8 Proxy and ImGui overlay for OkamiHD

Remember to change the Macros in the property sheet to your OkamiHD installation path so Visual Studio can directly output the dinput8.dll proxy to it, along with the pdb.

Press the end key to release your mouse cursor or navigate ImGui with your keyboard.
The freecam controls are wasd, with a 3x boost by pressing shift. The base speed can be adjusted through the ImGui overlay.
